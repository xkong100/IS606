```
Question 1. What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of data frame and what are the variable or column names?
```{r}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R")
present$year
dim(present)
names(present)
```
Question 2. How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they on a similar scale?
By comparing them, They both have the same variables: year, boys, and girls. However, because of the difference of the time, the amount of boys and girls are significantly different between Arbuthnot's and Present's.

Question 3. Make a plot that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year in the data set. What do you see? Does Arbuthnotâ€™s observation about boys being born in greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your response.
```{r}
plot(x=present$year, y= present$boy/present$girl)
```
I think Arbuthnot's observation still holds up because by observing the plot of present, from 1940 to 2000, the boy-girl ratio is slightly greater than 1 although the boy-girl ratio decreases between 1940 and 1960 and between 1975 and 2000. 

Question 4.In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.?
```{r}
present$births <- present$girl+present$boy
present[present$births == max(present$births), ]$year
```
